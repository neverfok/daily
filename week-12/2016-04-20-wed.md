Brant's challenge.

10:00 Debugging!
----------------

Lets practice debugging!
[Debugging](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/debugging.markdown)

Clone [this](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/erroneous_creatures)

Remember that you can tell mrspec to run a specific minitest test by calling
`meta(current: true)` before the method definition, and running the test like this:
`$ mrspec -t current`


12:00 Lunch
-----------

Eat the foods!


Homework
--------

* Make sure all the things you've done are on Github,
  they show what you're working on and what you've found interesting.
  It's not important to curate these, eg
  `$ curl -Ls https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek | grep public_`
* Go through the Zero to Oauth, until you can do it without reference.  Be able to do it, yourself, by Friday.
  * https://vimeo.com/162817133
  * https://vimeo.com/162817134
  * https://vimeo.com/162817135
* Have the Free Code Camp challenges through the advanced ones done by Sunday.
  Pair on the advanced ones.
  Hints:
  * I got the phone number one with a regular expression. You can try yours at [rubular](http://rubular.com/).
    Mine used:
    * `a?` would optionally match an `a`
    * `(ab)` would group `a` followed by `b`
    * `\d` would match any digit
    * `ab|cd` would match `ab` or `cd`... combine this with the grouping operator
    * `[ab]` would match an `a` or `b`, since the `-` has meaning within brackets, you need to put it at the beginning if you want to match it.
    * `^` to match the beginning of the line
    * `$` to match the end of the line
  * Do the date one when you're really awake
  * The `makePairs` one isn't as complicated as the description makes it seem,
    they're really just saying you can't reuse indexes.
  * JavaScript doesn't have integers, it only has floats that it sometimes doesn't show you what's after the decimal point.
    Keep that in mind if you get a strange answer on the `exact-change` challenge.
