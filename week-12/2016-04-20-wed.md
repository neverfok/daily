Remember that you can tell mrspec to run a specific minitest test by calling
`meta(current: true)` before the method definition, and running the test like this:
`$ mrspec -t current`

1:00 OO in Rails!?
------------------

Homework
--------

* Make sure all the things you've done are on Github,
  they show what you're working on and what you've found interesting.
  It's not important to curate these, eg
  `$ curl -Ls https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek | grep public_`
* Go through the Zero to Oauth, until you can do it without reference.  Be able to do it, yourself, by Friday.
