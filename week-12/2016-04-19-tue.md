Finish Open Closed Principle


2 hours - Object Model Challenges
---------------------------------

Lets review the [Object Model Challenges](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/ad9f70a6d855be9ed50d),
which we did back in phase 1. Now that
we've done some Rails, it will be helpful
to see how all these things work again,
and since we're doing challenges
anyway, these ones are particularly good :)
