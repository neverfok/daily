4:15 Tomorrow's project
-----------------------

Be here for this, we're going to talk about
the biggest learning opportunities from last
week's project, and how to get them right going
into the next one.


Homework
--------

* Go through the Zero to Oauth, until you can do it without reference.  Be able to do it, yourself, by tomorrow.
  * https://vimeo.com/162817133
  * https://vimeo.com/162817134
  * https://vimeo.com/162817135
* Have the Free Code Camp challenges through the advanced ones done by Sunday.
  Pair on the advanced ones.
  Hints:
  * I got the phone number one with a regular expression. You can try yours at [rubular](http://rubular.com/).
    Mine used:
    * `a?` would optionally match an `a`
    * `(ab)` would group `a` followed by `b`
    * `\d` would match any digit
    * `ab|cd` would match `ab` or `cd`... combine this with the grouping operator
    * `[ab]` would match an `a` or `b`, since the `-` has meaning within brackets, you need to put it at the beginning if you want to match it.
    * `^` to match the beginning of the line
    * `$` to match the end of the line
  * Do the date one when you're really awake
  * The `makePairs` one isn't as complicated as the description makes it seem,
    they're really just saying you can't reuse indexes.
  * JavaScript doesn't have integers, it only has floats that it sometimes doesn't show you what's after the decimal point.
    Keep that in mind if you get a strange answer on the `exact-change` challenge.
