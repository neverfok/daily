* Do this [JS Quiz](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase3/js_quiz.md)
* Redo one of the section 3 of the [ActiveRecord Deliberate Practice](https://github.com/JoshCheek/activerecord_deliberate_practice)
  in "Pass 3 optimized" style
* Do section 4, even if you aren't done with all the section 3 ones, then go back and do the rest of section 3.
  Ignore the blog one, I need to improve it a bit.

Happy hour with mock interviewers (tentative)


Homework
--------

* Finish the [ActiveRecord Deliberate Practice](https://github.com/JoshCheek/activerecord_deliberate_practice)
  exercises. Make sure you do it in the advocated style, you're caching the knowlege in your head,
  and your ability to just pump these out will be a massive advantage.
* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map)
  JSON API / AJAX, it will be helpful for tomorrow :)
