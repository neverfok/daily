10:00 - 12:00
-------------

Vue in isolation:

* Watch me build [this](http://codepen.io/josh_cheek/pen/zqmyap)
* As we build it, confirm that we know what each of the pieces are and where they go in a Rails app
* Then, delete random small bits and rewrite them to prove that we know what went there
* Then do the same, but for larger bits
* Then add a button that we can click to remove the item from the list (use the `filter` method)
* Then delete the whole thing and iteratively build it back up
* Contemplate what would need to change if we wanted to put it in a Rails app
