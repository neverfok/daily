Vue!

* Build [this](http://codepen.io/josh_cheek/pen/zqmyap) together
* As we build it, confirm that we know what each of the pieces are and where they go in a Rails app
* Then, delete random small bits and rewrite them to prove that we know what went there
* Then do the same, but for larger bits
  * Then modify the code so that as we type in the form, it edits the first item
  * Then change it to edit the last item
  * Then add a button that we can click to remove the item from the list (use the `filter` method)
* Then delete the whole thing and iteratively build it back up
* Contemplate what would need to change if we wanted to put it in a Rails app
