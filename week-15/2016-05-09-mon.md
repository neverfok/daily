* Make sure you can use Google Maps:
  * Copy / Paste [this](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#Audience)
    Google Maps example code into a local HTML file.
  * Open it in your browser to make sure it doesn't work (due to authentication).
  * [Get an API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
  * Add it to the HTML file and reload to make sure that it now works.
