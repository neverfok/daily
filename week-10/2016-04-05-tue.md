Get it so your robot can be told to go north / south / east / west.

* Revisit "How Ruby works" now that we've seen some Rails and been programming longer!
* Ruby's core values and their implications.
  Read an article explaining [Rust](http://designisrefactoring.com/2016/04/01/rust-via-its-core-values/?utm_content=buffer3dba1&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer),
  why it works the way it does, etc. I thought it was really good,
  and figured that understanding the values of Ruby would help explain a lot of the things you see that might not otherwise make sense.
* [Here](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map) are some challenges for the web, lets go through them!
* Continue with our API client, at this point we're basically there! We can talk about how to test the real server using [webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock)
