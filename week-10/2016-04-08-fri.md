====================

We're going to begin doing JS next week.
Lets spend some time getting familiar with it.

We'll do 1 hour of the
[Basic Javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicJavaScript)
portion of FreeCodeCamp. It's goal is to teach you the basics of JS.
As you go through it, pay attention to the names of the lessons and
try to identify what each lesson is trying to teach you.
You'll need this information for the next bit.

Now, 30 minutes of the
[Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicAlgorithmScripting),
try to get it correct the first time.
But if you really have no idea, then try to iteratively make progress towards the solution,
or move on to a different challenge.

Now another hour of the [Basic Javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicJavaScript)

And 30 more minutes of
[Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicAlgorithmScripting),


12:00 Lunch
-----------

1:00 JS
-------

Go for 30 more minutes of [Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicAlgorithmScripting).

1:30 Retro
----------

This morning was more structured, with challenges like we used to do in Challenges and Synseer,
and we've got a small project planned for next week. Thoughts on this vs the more self-driven
approach we've been doing?

2:30 Mystery surprise!
----------------------

Oooooh, what will it be!


Homework
--------

Was going to have y'all do a project :)
But some of y'all made weekend plans and shit (psh)
so we're going to swap some of next week's stuff instead.

* [Basic JS](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicJavaScript)
* [OOP / FP](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseObjectOrientedandFunctionalProgramming)
* Do any 5 of these [Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicAlgorithmScripting)
  they'll be useful for when we get to the intermediate and advanced algorithms.
  The time estimation on this one is for brand-new programmers, but you've got
  some experience with these sorts of problems already, so I think it'll take less time :)
* Do 5 of the [HTML5 and CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseHTML5andCSS).
  James and Greg went through them on Thursday and said the challenges
  helped them solve a problem in their app, so this should be pretty useful.
  I also learned some cool things when I sat down with them!
