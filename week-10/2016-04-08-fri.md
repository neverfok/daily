====================


We're going to begin doing JS next week.
Lets spend some time getting familiar with it.

We'll do 1 hour of the
[Basic Javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicJavaScript)
portion of FreeCodeCamp. It's goal is to teach you the basics of JS.
As you go through it, pay attention to the names of the lessons and
try to identify what each lesson is trying to teach you.
You'll need this information for the next bit.

Now, 30 minutes of the
[Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicAlgorithmScripting),
try to get it correct the first time.
But if you really have no idea, then try to iteratively make progress towards the solution,
or move on to a different challenge.

Now another hour of the [Basic Javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicJavaScript)

And 30 more minutes of
[Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicAlgorithmScripting),
